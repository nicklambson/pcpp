# Distinguishing between complex as consisting of many elements and complicated, meaning difficult to understand, is yet another thing to consider when writing code.

# In other words, there are times when a complex solution may be preferred over a simple one, especially in the case of the latter causing misunderstanding, doubt, or misinterpretation. You should avoid those.

# On the other hand, complex is always preferred to complicated. When your code gets big and too difficult to understand and grasp, divide it into well-separated parts, so that itâ€™s easier to manage and handle.

# too complicated.
